        <h1>Prices to send physical letters around the globe</h1>

        <p>Below you can calculate the price of letters send through our website. This calculator handles most common requests, but we also have a group of customers having unique needs (think logo on letters, registered mail and so forth, bigger batches for marketing purposes). If you have a special request, please @Html.ActionLink("contact us", "Contact")</p>

        <p>As of right now, we solely send windowed envelopes. Please test your position of the address information, before sending letters, by uploading a single letter in our "send a letter" form.</p>

                  When we started LMPost, we found out sending letters isn't free. But! We have done anything in our power to find the cheapest prices, so you can send letters world-wide cheaply.
              </p>
        <p>We have a wide range of subcontractors who help us deliver letters. Depending on your requirements, we provide the cheapest prices we have.</p>
