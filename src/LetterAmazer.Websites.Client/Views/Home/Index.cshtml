<p><b>We delivery very fast</b>. We want our letters to arrive at our customers <b>FAST</b>. Therefore, we have cherry picked providers that can promise the letters arrive within days, and not weeks as many other providers do.</p>

<h2>Send a letter online - sending snail mail internationally</h2>


<p>15 Years ago we were blessed with the invention of e-mail, and communication has been extremely easy since. However, we all send physical letters from time to time. </p>

<p>Sending physical letters is so tiresome. First you have to <strong>buy some windowed envelopes</strong>. Then you have to <strong>manually adjust the document</strong>, so the recipients address fit the window in the envelope. Then you have to <strong>print the documents on a printer</strong> (oh wait, who does actually own a working printer with ink these days?). Then you have to <strong>bend the paper</strong>, and manually put the <strong>paper down in the envelope</strong>. Afterwards, you have to close the envelope (if you are lucky they seal automatically, if you are unlucky you have to use your tongue). At last, you have forgotten to <strong>buy stamps</strong>, and you need to go <strong>down to the postal office and buy them</strong>. Then you can send your letters… if you can find a mailbox.</p>

<p>We have decided to fix this problem so none ever has to face it again.</p>

<p>We have made a service which makes it easy to send letters. You go to www.letteramazer.com, upload the letter as a file and then we send the letter for you. Easy, done deal.</p>

<p>Heck, this is especially easy if you have a business. You can create an account with some credits, so you don't have to worry about payment each time. Then you can easily send letters from our website without using any form of payment.

<p>Good. It's time to stop the madness. Enough time has been spent licking those damn envelopes and stamps. Let's save time and money, and make everyone happier.</p>

<p>Welcome to LetterAmazer.</p>
