   <h2>Why is LMPost a cheaper option?</h2>

    <p>The cost of sending letters is not limited to the postage fee. You have to factor in cost for envelopes, paper, stamps and time spent making the delivery.</p>
    <p>At LMPost we send <b>a lot</b> of letters. That means:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>We automate the process of sending letters. Everything from printing, inventory and delivery is done by machines</li>
        <li>We purchase large amounts of envelopes, paper and other supplies, so we offer cheaper prices</li>

    </ul>

    <p>
        <b>International letters</b>.
        <br />
        We have offices around the world, which means we can print and send letters locally. That allows us to maintain low prices, even lower than your local postal service.
    </p>
    <p><b>Our pricing list</b> is publically available. @Html.ActionLink("See the prices here", "Pricing").</p>

<h2>Automatic integration</h2>
    <p>If you send a lot of letters, or want to send letters inside an application, we have an answer for that as well.</p>
    <p>We have a working API. With this API, any application or software can send letters to any address in the world. We have previously experienced a lot of interest from:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Accounting departments</li>
        <li>Companies selling tickets</li>
        <li>New apps and software as a service (SAAS) services</li>
        <li>Potential resellers</li>
        <li>... and many others</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The truth is that most developers would be able to integrate with LetterAmazer within a couple of hours. We use a standard REST API, and provide solid documentation.</p>

<h2>Fast, convenient and stable</h2>
    <p>
        When a trained employee uses our system, it takes less than 5 seconds to send a windowed letter. That makes it extremely fast and convenient.
    </p>
    <p>We recognize that stability and uptime is extremely important. Therefore, we make sure of the following:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>We have multiple monitors on the website, so we can take measures if anything goes wrong</li>
        <li>We run a wide range of tests, every time we create new code, so we don't break existing features</li>
        <li>We are able to switch servers within hours, if something goes wrong</li>
        <li>We take daily backups</li>
    </ul>


<hr />

<h2>How about privacy?</h2>
    <p>Every employee working with our letters, signs a confidentiality agreement. That means your letters are safe with us, and you don't have to worry about privacy.</p>
